# x402 CLI tester

A simple tool to test x402-gated API endpoints.

Make sure you have funds on the chain of your choice, and that there is a `.env`
file present in the folder where you're running this which contains the KEY env
variable, which is a private key of a wallet that can be used.

Alternatively, provide the KEY as an environment variable.

Example usage:

```bash
bunx @swader/x402-cli <URL>
```

e.g.

```bash
bunx @swader/x402-cli https://fs9cqhm1.nx.link/random_joke
```
